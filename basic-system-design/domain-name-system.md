# Domain Name System (DNS)

## Example

### Phone Book

* Example of mobile phone where a unique number is associated with each user
* To make calls to friends, we can initially try to memorize some of the phone numbers
* As the number of contact grows, we'll have to use a phone book to keep track to all our contacts
* This way, whenever we need to make a call, we'll refer to the phone book and dial the number we need

### DNS

* Similarly, computers are uniquely assigned by IP address - for example, ```104.18.2.119``` is an IP address.
* Since, it is not possible to remember IP address to visit domain names (```google.com```), we need a repository, similar to phone book, that can maintain all the mappings of domain names to IP addresses.

## What is DNS?

* It maps human-friendly domain names to machine readable IP addresses.
* When a user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser has to translate the domain name to an IP address by asking the DNS infrastructure
* Once the desired IP address is obtained, the yser's request is forwarded to the destination web server
