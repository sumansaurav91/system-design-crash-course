# System Design Crash Course

### Definition

* It is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data model to build large-scale system that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements.

* System design uses the concepts of computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to craft systems that scale well and are performant.

* Characteristics:
    * Reliable systems: Handle faults, failures and errors
    * Effective systems: Meet all user needs and business requirements
    * Maintainable systems: Flexible and easy to scale up or down. Ability to add new features also comes under the umbrella of maintainability.
